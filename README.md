Throughout the 3 notebooks hourly and daily electricity demand will be analised using different models and methods as seen in Forecasting: Principles and Practice by Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos (https://otexts.com/fpp2/).   
The two datasets comprise data for electricity demand observed from different floors and for the whole building.
