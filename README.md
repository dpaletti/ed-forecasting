# Electricity Demand Forecasting
Throughout the 3 notebooks hourly and daily electricity demand will be analised using different models and methods as seen in Forecasting: Principles and Practice by Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos (https://otexts.com/fpp2/). The two datasets comprise data for electricity demand observed from different floors and for the whole building. Hourly data describe January 2019 while daily observations begin in 2017 and end in february 2019.
